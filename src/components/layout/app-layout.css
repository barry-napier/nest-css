* description: Application layout component styles.
* This file defines the styles for application layout components including container, sidebar, header, main content, and footer.
*
* USAGE RULES:
* - These classes are for application-level layouts (not individual components)
* - Always use .app-container as the root wrapper for full-page layouts
* - Use .app-sidebar only when you need a persistent global navigation sidebar
* - .app-content must always wrap header, main, and footer sections
* - These classes should not be mixed with generic layout classes (.header, .footer, etc.)
*/
